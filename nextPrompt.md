The next things we want to include:

- Update theme to cover other colours (e.g. settings saved / sync)

- Add in calculations for the income breakdown for the month. Default to only showing the net income, but have the option for an expanded view that shows all the fields.

- Add alternative views to hours, such as weekly and fortnightly (feature flag)

- Add the ability to add salary sacrifice options, as well as a novated lease.

- Have a configurable number of hours that can be tracked, with the default one being work. Have the ability to have multiple "work" hours. If there is more than one type of hours then have a dropdown that displays all the choices, defaulting to work.
    * Have this behind a feature flag

- Add a contract burndown view that can be loaded for a selected contract

- Assuming the contracts page gets expanded views, move the new contract settings to a button instead of always being at the bottom of the screen

- Add the invoice requirements (all behind feature flags)

- Add a thinkStack employee feature flag, which will do things like include the lost super in the expected pay

- Add BAS tracking
    * Enable both monthly and quarterly payments
