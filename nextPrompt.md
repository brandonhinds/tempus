The next things we want to include:

- Fix being able to switch back and forth between basic and advanced views for existing dates.

- Add alternative views to hours, such as weekly and fortnightly (feature flag)

- Add the ability to add salary sacrifice options, as well as a novated lease.

- Have a configurable number of hours that can be tracked, with the default one being work. Have the ability to have multiple "work" hours. If there is more than one type of hours then have a dropdown that displays all the choices, defaulting to work.
    * Have this behind a feature flag

- Add the invoice requirements (all behind feature flags)

- Add a thinkStack employee feature flag, which will do things like include the lost super in the expected pay

- Add BAS tracking
    * Enable both monthly and quarterly payments

- Add ability to switch months using a date picker (with just months and years)

- Add ability to add actual pay for comparison

- Update some settings to force a cache flush when enabled or updated (e.g the superannuation percentage)

- Remove the New Entry button from the entries list at the bottom of the sheet.

- Have a new, basic time entry mode where someone just puts in the total hours. In this mode double clicking on a calendar cell would allow the entry to be directly edited there. This mode would need to be feature flagged because it would be incompatible with the other data entry methods.

- Add Xero reporting mode

- Make it clear that the "Save Settings" button needs to be clicked when settings are updated. The theme, for example switches immediately, even though it has not be saved.
