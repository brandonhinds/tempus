The next things we want to do include:

- Create a setting for the theme, and have the option for different themes.

- Add in calculations for the income breakdown for the month. Default to only showing the net income, but have the option for an expanded view that shows all the fields.

- Add the ability to add salary sacrifice options, as well as a novated lease.

- Have a configurable number of hours that can be tracked, with the default one being work. Have the ability to have multiple "work" hours. If there is more than one type of hours then have a dropdown that displays all the choices, defaulting to work.
