# Actual Income

Available when the *Enable actual income tracking* feature flag under the *Income* section is enabled.

## Purpose
Record income actually received and compare against estimated earnings. This feature allows you to track variance between calculated income (based on hours worked) and what you actually receive, accounting for timing differences, adjustments, and other real-world factors.

## Accessing the Feature
- Enable the *Enable actual income tracking* feature flag in Settings under the *Income* section.
- Navigate to the Time Entry page.
- Select the month you want to record actual income for using the month navigation.
- Click the *Add Actual Income* button at the bottom of the page.

## Recording Actual Income

The actual income form captures four key values that should match your payslip or bank deposit:

- **Gross Income**: Total income before any deductions or tax.
- **Superannuation**: Total super contributions (guarantee + extra).
- **Tax**: Tax withheld for this pay period.
- **Net Income**: Your actual take-home amount.

### Workflow
1. Navigate to the desired month on the Time Entry page.
2. Click the *Add Actual Income* button.
3. Enter the values from your payslip:
   - Gross income (required)
   - Super amount
   - Tax withheld
   - Net income
4. Save to record the actual values.

## Where Actual Income Appears

### Income Breakdown Badge
- Found on the Time Entry page for months with actual income recorded.
- Shows estimated vs actual values side-by-side for comparison.
- Displays variance to highlight differences between calculated and actual income.
- Helps identify discrepancies that may need investigation.

### Annual Views
- Months with actual income data are used in annual calculations instead of estimates.
- Monthly bars in the income breakdown chart are highlighted with a border to indicate actual data.
- Provides more accurate year-to-date totals when actual income is consistently recorded.

## Tips
- Record actual income after receiving payment to ensure accuracy.
- Use after invoices are paid to keep variance meaningful (for contract workers).
- Review variance regularly to identify patterns or issues with rate calculations.
- If variance is consistently high, check your contract rates or hour type settings.
- Actual income is month-specific - you can have a mix of estimated and actual months in the same year.

## Summary

Actual Income replaces Tempus's calculated estimates with your real earnings figures. Record what you actually received each month to identify variances, track financial accuracy, and ensure annual reports reflect reality rather than projections.
