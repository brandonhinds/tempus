# Rate Preview

Available when `contract_rate_preview` is enabled.

## Purpose
- Model hourly rate changes for a contract and review projected impacts on income, super, tax, and net.

## Workflow
- Open Rate Preview page (flagged).
- Select a contract and choose change type (percentage or absolute).
- Review lifetime summary and month-by-month variances.

## Calculations
- Treats contract rates as total package (includes employer super).
- Gross derived by removing super portion before estimating tax/net to match dashboard logic.

## Tips
- Use alongside contract history updates; this is a sandbox and does not alter stored rates.
- Test with company tracking on/off to understand variance shifts.
