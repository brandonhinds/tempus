# Print View

Available when `enable_monthly_print_view` is enabled.

## Purpose
- Produce a printable monthly calendar showing hour breakdowns by type on one A4 page.

## Usage
- Open the Print View page when the flag is on.
- Select month/year and print via browser print dialog.

## Tips
- Ensure entries are up to date before printing; hour type colours follow the active theme.
- Layout uses the wider container for readability on desktop; check print preview for scaling.
