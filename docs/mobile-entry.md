# Mobile Entry Overview

Current mobile experience and limitations compared to desktop.

## Purpose
- Lightweight entry flow for updating timesheets on mobile.

## Capabilities
- Mobile shell hosts a single-day calendar card that mirrors the desktop calendar styling.
- Day navigation uses the desktop-style switcher, showing the selected date in `dd/mm/yyyy`.
- Hour type chips appear inside the day card when multiple hour types are enabled.
- Basic and Advanced inputs mirror desktop behaviors, including edit/delete for existing entries.

## Known Gaps
- Feature set is reduced versus desktop; some advanced features (invoices, BAS, helpers) are desktop-only.
- Mobile entry link is currently removed from the desktop nav while the flow is reworked.

## Tips
- Prefer desktop for full-feature workflows (defaults management, invoices, BAS, payroll helpers).
- Use consistent hour types/contracts to keep data aligned across devices.
